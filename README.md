# Peer-To-Peer-POC

This is a Peer-To-Peer energy trading site that trades renewable energy between two different wallet addresses.

**NOTE** This is still a work in progress so some functions won't properly work. 
_______

Here's how it works

Users sign up for their Metamask wallet and since I have no API for the amount of energy they have, they input their amount with the increment function.

With sample energy, they can use the main functions:

1. Listing the energy they possess to the market
2. Buy energy from the market
3. and to view how much energy they currently own

I am currently working on an additional function to register your local renewable energy data using timestamps and location, but this is in the future.
